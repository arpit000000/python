In general, the use of threads is most beneficial when you have multiple CPU-bound
or I/O-bound tasks that can be executed independently and concurrently. If your program does not have such tasks, 
or if the tasks are not suitable for concurrent execution, 
then using threads may not provide any benefits and could even degrade performance due to the overhead of thread creation and management.
